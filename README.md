Build specification:

* Python 3.6

### Setting up virtual env

Python 3.6 is cutting edge.  As a result some things are "wonky".  

In order to get virtual env working you'll need to do:

`virtualenv -p $(which python3) venv` 

to set up the virtual env.

This is just a test, it wil be removed in a few.
